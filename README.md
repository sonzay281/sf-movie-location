This project was bootstrapped with [React Project Template ](https://github.com/sonzay281/react-project-template-ts).

# SF Movie Location

SF Movie Location is a web service which shows the movie filmed locations in San Francisco,USA.

The initial requirement was to make a web service that shows on a map where movies have been filmed in San Francisco. The user should be able to filter the view using autocompletion search.
As per the requirement, this web service works exactly as per the requirements.

The service is fully frontend focused and fetching the movie detail from an open source API [data.sfgov.org](https://data.sfgov.org/resource/yitu-d5am.json) and using Google Map API for location purpose.

## Trade-offs

Every thing is fulfilled as per the requirements but still there are few things that can be done in future release. Some of them includes fetching the `rating`, `poster` from `IMDB` api.

There is one package for location to lat,lng which only includes in build but not in source available here in git. The pin points may not appear if you run without the package. Please let me know if you want to actualy try the code.
